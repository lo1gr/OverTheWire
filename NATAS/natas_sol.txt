For a level 99:

username: natas99

Level 0:
username: natas0
password: natas0
url: http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org

To find password, view page source and look for password.

Level 1:
username: natas1
password: gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto

Right clicking is blocked so have to use shortcut: cmd + option + u to open page source.

Level2:
username: natas2
password: ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi

Check out page source with shortcut. We dont see any password. We see image at link http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/pixel.png
So check out the link http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files and find out a file called user.txt
click on it -> password found!

Level3:
username: natas3
password:sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14

Check out page source code. it says that "<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->
"
If Google cannot find it, that mean the crawlers cannot find it, so it could be a robots.txt file:
http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt
Output is:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t/

So let's check out the /s3cr3t/ folder: http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/
We find user.txt file -> password found!

Level4:
username: natas4
password: Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ

This message: "Access disallowed. You are visiting from "" while authorized
users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/""

so have to fake where we come from, can do that with curl in the terminal:
curl 'http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/' -H 'Referer: http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/' -u natas4
-H specifies the Header, in that case a Referer

-> password found!

Level5:
username: natas5
password: iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq

need to check the cookies for that:
right click > Inspect > Applications > Under storage: Cookies
Now change logged in = 0 to logged in = 1
refresh website. Password will be outputted on website!
-> password found!

Level6:
link: http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
username: natas6
password: aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1

Have to enter a password to find the code.
We click on the provided link to view source code and find following javascript:

<?

include "includes/secret.inc";

    if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
        if($secret == $_POST['secret']) {
        print "Access granted. The password for natas7 is <censored>";
    } else {
        print "Wrong secret";
    }
    }
?>

It checks the entered value against a secret obtained from the file 'includes/secret.inc'.
Let's check out this file -> http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc

Level7:
link: http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
username: natas7
password: 7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9

We see a hint in the page source:
<!-- hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -->
We see that the page structure is always: http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page= then the page
so we can try to put the hint after the page= like so:
http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8
-> password found!

Level 9:

There is a passcode to enter on the website. In the source code we find the
following php excerpt:

<?

$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
}

if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
    if(encodeSecret($_POST['secret']) == $encodedSecret) {
    print "Access granted. The password for natas9 is <censored>";
    } else {
    print "Wrong secret";
    }
}
?>

So the passcode we enter goes into a function, and the output is compared with the
$encodedSecret variable.

encodeSecret($passcode_entered) == "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362"

So need to go from output, and reverse the functions in the right order to get the input.
We need to run the following php command:

echo base64_decode(strrev(pack("H*" , "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362")))
This gives us: oubWYf2kBq
which we input in the website then submit.
--> password found!
